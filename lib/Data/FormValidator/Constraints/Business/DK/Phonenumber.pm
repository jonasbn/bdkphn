=head1 NAME

Data::FormValidator::Constraints::Business::DK::Phonenumber - a DFV constraints wrapper

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Data::FormValidator::Business::DK::Phonenumber qw(valid_dk_phonenumber);

    my $dfv_profile = {
        required => [qw(phonenumber)],
        constraint_methods => {
            phonenumber => valid_dk_phonenumber(),
        }
    };

    my $input_hash;
    my $result;

    $input_hash = {
        phonenumber  => 1234567,
    };

    $result = Data::FormValidator->check($input_hash, $dfv_profile);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements experimental L<Data::FormValidator> constraints.

=head1 SUBROUTINES AND METHODS

=head2 valid_dk_phonenumber

This method validates a string for resemblance to a valid Danish telephone number.

=head2 match_dk_phonenumber

This subroutine can be used for untainting a parameter.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item * Please refer to L<Data::FormValidator>

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

The module is intended for use with L<Data::FormValidator>.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

No known incompatibilities at this time.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No known bugs or limitations at this time.

=head1 TEST AND QUALITY

=over

=item * The L<Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::RequireNumberSeparators>
policy has been disabled. We are working with phonenumbers, strings consisting primarily of number, so not special interpretation or calculative behaviour is needed.

=item * L<Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitConstantPragma> policy has been disabled. I like constants.

=item * L<Perl::Critic::Policy::InputOutput::RequireBracedFileHandleWithPrint> policy has been disabled for now should be revisited at some point.

=head1 MOTIVATION

I have been working in Telco for a long time. So validation and formatting of
telephone numbers is something I have seen at lot of. This module is an attempt
to sort of consolidate the numerous different regular expression solutions
I have seen scathered over large code bases.
